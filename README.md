# Laptop Price Prediction

This model predicts laptop prices using Linear Regression. The dataset includes various features such as brand, processor speed, RAM size, storage capacity, weight, and screen size.

To determine which model performs closer to actual prices, the model employs rigorous evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²) score. These metrics help in quantifying prediction accuracy and understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
